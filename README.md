A user interface for BluePov
============================

    Note: This was coded by my partner Maximiliano Fernandez,
    since he is not a git user I'm uploading this for him.

This program allows the user to draw with the mouse using 64 colors and send the result to the BluePoV display.
It also can load an image from a file, show a clock, and control some variables of the display.

BluePoV is a persistence of vision display communicated over bluetooth.
The display, developed over 8 weeks, is the final project of Pio IX secondary school.
